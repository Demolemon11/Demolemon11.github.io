## Ongoing tasks:
Keep on doing refining the `Settings` page, under `home/spaces_dock.rs`.
I reloaded the back ground of button's view.


## Difficulties:
After reloading button's view in the dock, I am tyring to do the actual `Settings` page.
I refered moly, there are many Page, at the begining, just hide the `RoomScreen` & `RoomSidebar`,
but there is a large amount of code in moly, it is not convinint for me to find the effctive code for page changing.


## WorkInsights:

There are supposed to appaer more shared components, IMHO.
